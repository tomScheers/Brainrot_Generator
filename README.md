# Brainrot Generator
This is a Python Script that will generate a "Brainrot" Reddit post, which gets a random Reddit post from a subreddit (am I the asshole) and underlays it on another video.

## Usage
Copy this script into a new directory, then find a video file which you want to use as a background video and download it into the Vid_Com directory as vid.mp4. Then run the program through `python3 main.py` which will generate a video in the Output directory
